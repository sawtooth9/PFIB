I am excited to start sharing my investment moves! However, since I am not starting from scratch and have an existing portfolio this post will share what my starting point is. 

While this is the high level overview of my current portfolio, it will be kicking off a new series that will take a deep dive into each position within my portfolio. The goal here is to document my current and historical thinking of each position and make up for the documenting that I have not done in the past.
