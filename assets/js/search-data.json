            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

            "content": "Welcome to my investing and personal finance blog! . I am excited to start documenting and sharing my investment moves as well as what I learn about personal finance along the way. I am starting this blog for a few reasons which I will articulate in the Mission, Vision, and Intent below. However, I have been investing in stocks and options for about 5 years now. I was fascinated by investing long before I had the money or knowledge to do it on my own, and developed a passion for personal finance as I continue to learn how many people fall behind the financial literacy curve and how easy it is to do so. . While the initial purpose of this blog is to help document and vet my own decisions, I hope sharing with the community can drive the purpose far beyond that. Helping others learn and achieve their personal financial goals is my primary interest. I hope this blog is the first major step I am able to take down that path. . Mission: . To create a space for documenting and sharing my thought processes for stock investments as well as culminating a repository of learnings around personal finance. Ultimately leveraging the writing process to enhance my learning and improve my investment decisions. . Vision: . A platform that documents investment moves for sanity in the present and analysis in the future. All while keeping investing in the purview of sound personal finance. . The cadence and content of blog posts I plan to structure similarly to the CNBC Investment Club run by Jim Cramer except for my own portfolio. Highlighting the moves I am making (or not making), why I am making them, thoughts on earnings results/other corporate events, and general market conditions. In addition to the posts focused specifically around investments I plan to share thoughts and learnings on other topics in personal finance as well since investing is just one small portion to a healthy, personal financial life. . Intent: . To maximize investing performance and share the knowledge acquired in the process. .",
